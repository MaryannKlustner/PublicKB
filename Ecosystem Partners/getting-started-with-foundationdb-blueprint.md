### Steps

1. **Locate the Blueprint in the Blueprint Library**

  Click either of the items at right to access that Blueprint directly.

  [![](../images/foundationdb/foundation-1.png)](https://control.tier3.com/blueprints/browser/details/2002) 
  [![](../images/foundationdb/foundation-2.png)](https://control.tier3.com/blueprints/browser/details/2089)

  Alternately, starting from the CenturyLink Control Panel, navigate to the Blueprints Library. Search for “FoundationDB” in the keyword search on the right side of the page.

2. **Click the Deploy Blueprint button.**
3. **Set Required parameters.**

  Select "FD1" in the drop down if not pre-populated - this will be your master server.

4. **Set Optional Parameters**

  ![](../images/foundationdb/foundation-3.png)

  Password/Confirm Password (This is the root password for the server. Keep this in a secure place).

  Set DNS to “Manually Specify” and use “8.8.8.8” (or any other public DNS server of your choice).

  Optionally set the server name prefix.

  The default values are fine for every other option.

5. **Review and Confirm the Blueprint**

6. **Deploy the Blueprint**

  Once verified, click on the ‘deploy blueprint’ button. You will see the deployment details stating the Blueprint is queued for execution.

  This will kick off the blueprint deploy process and load a page to allow you to track the progress of the deployment. Generally, it will take 15 to 20 minutes to configure all of the components.

7. **Deployment Complete**

  Once the Blueprint has finished execution you will receive an email confirming the newly deployed assets.

8. **Validate Foundation DB Core Installation**

  Login to your master server and execute the fdbcli tool.  If your display looks similar to the image at right your database is ready to use.

  ```
  [root@VA1KRAPFDB101 ~]# fdbcli
  Using cluster file `/etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster'.
  
  The database is available.
  
  Welcome to the fdbcli. For help, type `help'.

  Client time: Mon Feb 23 17:00:42 2015
  ```

9. **Validate SQL Layer Installation (optional)**

  Login to your SQL server and execute the 'fdbsqlcli' tool.  Execute the command `SELECT VERSION();` and verify a response similar to the image at right.

  ```
  [root@VA1KRAPSQL101 ~]# fdbsqlcli
  fdbsql (driver 2.0, layer 2.0.2)
  root=> SELECT VERSION();
         _SQL_COL_1
		 -----------------------------
		  FoundationDB 2.0.2 +1059266
			(1 row)

  root=>
